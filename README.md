we released the SRSDD-v1.0 dataset. Compared
with other existing SAR ship datasets, the unique advantages of our SRSDD-v1.0 dataset
are fourfold.
##1. All data in the dataset are from GF-3 Spotlight (SL) mode with a 1-m resolution and
each image has 1024 × 1024 pixels, which is relatively larger and can contain more
abundant information.
##2. The data of inshore scenes occupy a proportion of 63.1%, with complex backgrounds
and much interference, making detection more challenging.
##3. We used the rotatable box to label the target, which is helpful for detecting dense
targets and effectively excluding interference.
##4. Compared with other existing datasets, the dataset contains multiple categories,
namely a total of six categories of 2884 ships
